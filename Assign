Assignment 1: Employee Management System
Use these: Structs, Methods, Pointers, Slices, Maps
Problem Statement:Create a simple Employee Management System that allows adding employees, updating their salary, and displaying their details.
Requirements:
1. Define a struct Employee with fields:
    * ID (int)
    * Name (string)
    * Salary (float64)
2. Implement methods:
    * UpdateSalary(newSalary float64) → Updates the salary of an employee.
    * Display() → Prints employee details.
3. Use a map to store employees (map[int]*Employee).
4. Implement functions:
    * AddEmployee(emp *Employee, db map[int]*Employee) → Adds an employee to the map.
    * RemoveEmployee(id int, db map[int]*Employee) → Removes an employee by ID.


Assignment 2: Temperature Converter
Use these: Methods, Receivers, Pointers
Problem Statement:Create a program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
Requirements:
1. Define a struct Temperature with a Value (float64).
2. Implement methods:
    * ToFahrenheit() → Converts from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
    * ToCelsius() → Converts from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
3. Use pointers to modify the temperature directly.
Formula:
* °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32
* °C = (°F - 32) × 5/9
